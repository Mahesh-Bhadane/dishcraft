# Recipe Book Application

This is a simple Recipe Book application built using React, Tailwind CSS, and Redux Query. It allows users to browse through a collection of recipes fetched from the [MealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/).

## Design Decisions

### Frameworks and Libraries Used:
- **React**: Chosen for its declarative and component-based approach, which simplifies UI development.
